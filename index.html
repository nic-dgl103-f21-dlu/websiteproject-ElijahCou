			<h2>RCSCC 189 Port Augusta - Comox Valley Sea Cadets</h2>	<!--Title-->
		</header>
		<div>
			<p>Welcome to RCSCC 189 Port Augusta. Sea cadets is a civilian youth program delivered in partnership by the Navy League of Canada and the Department of National Defence. RCSCC 189 Port Augusta in Comox is one of the 237 communities across Canada delivering the Royal Canadian Sea cadet program. We parade on Tuesday nights from September to June between 1800-2100 at HMCS Quadra which is located on Goose Spit at the end of Hawkins Road in Comox, B.C. Youth aged 12-18 who join sea cadets will learn seamanship, from tying knots to sailing through the waves, navigation, power boat operation, look out duties, small boat sailing, marksmanship, drill and adventure training.</p>
			<p>Our cadet programme is lots of fun, and uses a traditional Naval theme as a platform to develop valuable life skills like leadership, teamwork, discipline, organization, citizenship, physical fitness, and effective communication. Along with regular mandatory maritime training, our cadets have recently participated in visits to the 19 Wing base pool, camping, orienteering, hiking, white water rafting, caving, rock climbing, and tubing at Mt. Washington as well as trips to Victoria and Hornby Island at the Outdoor Education Centre.</p>

			<h3>History Of RCSCC 189 Port Augusta Sea Cadets</h3>
			
			<p>RCSCC 189 Port Augusta Sea Cadets was first formed as the Boys Naval Brigade in 1902-1912 and was known as the Komox Branch. It was later reformed as the Navy League Cadets and operated from 1927-1935. When the building they met in was burnt down, the corps folded. The sea cadet corps Port Augusta was formed in 1941 and ran until 1948, then from 1957-1960. In 1964, four ex service men (Bob McKellar, Wally Allen, Norm Howarth and George Whitehead) restarted the sea cadet corps in Comox and it has operated ever since.</p>
